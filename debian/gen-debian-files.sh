# Script to generate debian files for dual landing in Vivid (gcc 4.9 ABI)
# and Wily and later (gcc 5 ABI).
#
# This script is called from debian/rules and generates:
#
# - control
# - liblocationd${soversion}.install.${target_arch}
#
# For all but control, this is a straight substition and/or renaming exercise for each file.
# For control, if building on Wily or later, we also fix the "Replaces:" and "Conflicts:"
# entries, so we don't end up with two packages claiming ownership of the same places
# in the file system.
#
# Because the debian files for the different distributions are generated on the fly,
# this allows us to keep a single source tree for both distributions. See ../HACKING
# for more explanations.
